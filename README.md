# Raid Planner
 WIP - A blazor project that requires user log in with Discord to display Unity Player and passes user data to Unity Player to be used in app.
 At current stage, displays user profile image and name at the top menu in the player.
 When completed, it will be a raid/party planning app for a gaming group.
